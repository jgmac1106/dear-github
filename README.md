#### Dear GitHub,

You have done so much to grow the open source community and make it really
accessible to users. Somehow you have us chasing stars and filling up squares,
improving the world’s software in the process.

However, many of us are frustrated. Those of us who run some of the most popular
projects on GitHub feel completely ignored by you. We’ve gone through the only
support channel that you have given us either to receive an empty response or
even no response at all. We have no visibility into what has happened with our
requests, or whether GitHub is working on them. Since our own work is usually
done in the open and everyone has input into the process, it seems strange for
us to be in the dark about one of our most important project dependencies.

The problems we most frequently have, and our best ideas for how to address
them, are:

- Issues are often filed missing crucial information like reproduction steps or
  version tested. We’d like issues to gain custom fields, along with a mechanism
  (such as a mandatory issue template, perhaps powered by a newissue.md in root
  as a likely-simple solution) for ensuring they are filled out in every issue.
- Issues often accumulate content-less “+1” comments which serve only to spam
  the maintainers and any others subscribed to the issue. These +1s serve a
  valuable function in letting maintainers know how widespread an issue is, but
  their drawbacks are too great. We’d like issues to gain a first-class voting
  system, and for content-less comments like “+1” or “:+1:” or “me too” to
  trigger a warning and instructions on how to use the voting mechanism.

- Issues and pull requests are often created without any adherence to the
  CONTRIBUTING.md contribution guidelines, due to the inconspicuous nature of
  the “guidelines for contributing” link when creating an issue and the fact
  that it often contains a lot of information that isn’t relevant to opening
  issues (such as information about hacking on the project). Maintainers should
  be able to configure a file in the repo (interpreted as GFM) to be displayed
  at the top of the new issue / PR page instead of that link. Maintainers can
  choose to inline content there and / or link to other pages as appropriate.

Hopefully none of these are a surprise to you as we’ve told you them before.
We’ve waited years now for progress on any of them. If GitHub were open source
itself, we would be implementing these things ourselves as a community—we’re
very good at that!

Signed,

[GitHub users](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGsg02jS-PnlIMJ3OlWIOEmhtG-udTwuDz_vsQPBHKs/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Dear Open Source Maintainers,

We hear you and we're sorry. We've been slow to respond to your letter and slow to respond to your frustrations.

We're working hard to fix this. Over the next few weeks we'll begin releasing a number of improvements to Issues, many of which will address the specific concerns raised in the letter. But we're not going to stop there. We'll continue to focus on Issues moving forward by adding new features, responding to feedback, and iterating on the core experience. We've also got a few surprises in store.

Issues haven't gotten much attention from GitHub these past few years and that was a mistake, but we've never stopped thinking about or caring about you and your communities. However, we know we haven't communicated that. So in addition to improving Issues, we're also going to kick off a few initiatives that will help give you more insight into what's on our radar. We want to make sharing feedback with GitHub less of a black box experience and we want to hear your ideas and concerns regularly.

We'll be in touch next week. Sorry it's taken so long, and thank you for everything.

—GitHub

**Dear GitHub Users**
You give so much to the world through open source development. Please do not get frustrated as the discourses used in issues shift. As more and more  non-developers turn to, or are steered toward, GitHub new ways of acting, talking, and being will also emerge.

Many organizations, fields, and people have seen what GitHub has to offer. They  align with the values of the open source development community but they do not speak language. Now that users can add and upload files from the web interface this expansion will only continue to grow. The social nature of issues will involve. In fact they will become much more social. 

> I use discourses here in the use commonly associated with James Paul Gee's Big Discourse theory. Which basically boils down to, "You wouldn't ask for a lighter the same way in a biker bar as you would a posh cigar bar in Cambridge." Using different literacy practices could get you punched in the face in this example. In many ways developers can be the bikers or the cigar bar patrons, you have very specialized ways of writing and talking that signify your membership in the clan.

I see an unavoidable increase in the [three concerns](https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github) you bring up as non-developers will be onboarded to GitHub. In the first example I see the foundations of the "first bug" approach to onboarding new open source developers. An "open bug" approach will not work for the not-for-profit or educationOER crowd that has started to turn to git. We are going to blog through issues, discuss long term planning, have debates, and possbily strat chain letters by forking someone else's letter repo.

In terms of emojis and plus ones....This is only the beginning. Issues will become the social stream of GitHub as more non-developers become onboarded. Emojis are baked into GitHub flavored Markdown. Luckily most non-techincal people haven't heard of markdown so you are safe for a bit, but a flood is coming. Only to be outdown by the tidal wave of impending GIFS that will fill issues.

In your final request you call users out for not adhering to to the Contribution.md file. New users have no idea what you are talking about here. So your idea is a good one. Most non-techincal folks will have no idea what a pull-request is without serious onboarding so it won't be as big an issue with us folks. Still the idea of getting some kind of automatic file opening with instructions( and dare I say a tutorial) would help.

To think about your three concerns and non-technical contributors lets return to the "the first bug." Developers have the mindset that the "first bug" is the way to increase participation.It has worked in the open source community for sometime. Someone will come to your repo, look at the issues, and maybe choose something labeled "first bug." Yet for the non-technical contributoprs they will need to be **brought** to a repo. Their **first bug** will be connected to whatever passion brought them to a project.

They will begin by filing issues full of questions and emojis, they will hijack threads, and file new issues about minor complaionts of what isn't working. It essence it is up to mantainers of repos to model and mentor the specific ways you want issues to be used. This is more of a human issue rather than a tool issue. 

Yes  some discourses of developers will be taken up as different communities merge. Yet other new and unforseen affordances of "issues" will be created and unearthed as we all join the branch.  To illustate I already see issues evolving as a non-technical contributor to Mozilla. People have tried to keep GitHub reserved for technical issus such as grammar and code. Then topical discussions are supposed to happen somewhere else. The conversation gets split and contributors get lost.

What has evolved in our use case is a two platform soultion where discussion happens one place and work happens on GitHub. 
What I believe will happen is the continued forking of how you think issues should be used. New users are going to figure out new hacks and work arounds. 

Furthermore different discourses are emerging naturally depending on who mantains the Mozilla repos. Adherence to issues as a "bug ticket" is naturally more prevalent on the Mozilla Corporation side (the technical half) and the Mozilla Foundation side (the thinking half). Yet each repo develops its own identity. Please do not advocate for a technical solution that tries force specific discourses on different grups.


So for the GitHub team I ask you to think strategically about the evolution of issues to account for both the "discussion" and the "work" of open source development. I think you need to consider the increase in non technical users turing to GitHub. Those of us without coding skills strengthen open source projects. GitHub may become a repo of Open Education Resources. Plan accordingly.

For project managers and repo mantainers I ask that you plan more than a Contribution.md file. Think about how non technical users can help your project. Develop strategies to recruit and onboarrd to GitHub (kudos for eliminating command line). Most of all don't freak when we +1 and emojify your issue. Instead work with us and explain how your ways of writing, reading, and being work in the repo.
